# blog-api

This is my solution for the [blog api](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api) project. This repository will contain the REST API. I will protect it by a simple JWT authentication. Only registered users will be able  to comment or create own blog posts. I will be able to delete posts or inappropriate comments as the admin of the site.
